# Allan's ComfyUI nodes

These are not the nodes you're looking for.

This is actually a private set of nodes (though obviously not confidential) that need to be hosted in a repo that does not require authentication.

I have no plans to distribute and/or advertise this project.

## Notes

* The `depth_anything_v2` package was copied verbatim from https://huggingface.co/spaces/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2
* The `Write Text to Image` node uses the Calibri Bold font (`calibrib.ttf`, which I chose not to include). It may easily be acquired from any Windows installation under `C:\WINDOWS\FONTS`
